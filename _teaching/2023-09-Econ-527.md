This course is a rigorous introduction to econometric theory. The main focus is the linear regression model. The course covers estimation and inference using ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized least squares (GLS), generalized method of moments (GMM) and instrumental variables (IV). It also covers maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of binary choice models (logit and probit), and some topics in time series.
